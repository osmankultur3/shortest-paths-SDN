# shortest-paths-SDN
just a description of my work on R&amp;D internship about algorithms(check the credits section)

# description
In my internship, it was important to learn how Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Dijkstra’s algorithms work. Because, in the project, which my supervisor involved, the shortest paths shall be found in an SDN based network and those paths shall satisfy some constraints such as bandwidth and network speed. At the end of the day, the company developed the algorithm which chooses the shortest path for data flow with taking into account the constraints. I was involved with the processes as doing research on how to develop a shortest path algorithm with different constraints, but I can provide no more information about the algorithm because of the non-disclosing liabilities. In this section, those three algorithms are mentioned briefly, the team chose to continue with an algorithm close to Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
